## workflow-decision-1: Comments do not count toward the 600-line ceiling

`main.ts` and `renderer.ts` are measured in code lines with `grep -cvE '^\s*(//|$)'`. Comments are never
dropped or packed to fit. This branch moved `processTree`, `baseBranch` and `shellLivesIn` out of
`main.ts`, and `showPicker` and page syncing out of `renderer.ts`, instead.
